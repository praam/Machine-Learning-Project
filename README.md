# Machine-Learning-Project
This project aims to implement machine learning models on the large data sets of the airline and retail industry. The data sets which were used in this project are the Rossman store, airline customers satisfaction, and the flight price. The aim was to predict the sales, customer satisfaction, and airfare price. This project encompasses multiple regression, logistic regression,k-nearest neighbors, decision tree regression, and random forest regression, models. The project uses Knowledge Discovery in Databases(KDD) methodology. Each model has been evaluated with respective measuring metrics and the results have been predicted.
